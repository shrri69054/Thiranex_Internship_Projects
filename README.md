1. Sales & Revenue Dashboard
An interactive web dashboard for exploring sales and revenue data across products and regions.
Features
Upload CSV or Excel sales files directly in the browser
Filter data by Region and Product using sidebar controls
KPI cards for Total Sales, Total Revenue, and Average Revenue
Interactive charts: Revenue trend (line), Top products (bar), Revenue by region (pie)
Full data table view

2. Customer Segmentation Analysis
A modular Python project that applies K-Means clustering to segment customers based on behavioural and demographic features.
Features
Data preprocessing with feature scaling (`StandardScaler`)
K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer groups
Insight generation per segment
Visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly

3. Data Cleaning & Reporting Automation
An automated Python pipeline that cleans raw employee HR data, generates a department-level summary report, and produces a bar chart — all in one script.
Features
Removes duplicate records
Fills missing `Department` values with `"Unknown"`
Imputes missing `Salary` and `Performance_Score` with median values
Exports cleaned data to `cleaned_employee_data.csv`
Generates a department summary report (`department_report.xlsx`) with:
Average salary
Average performance score
Employee count
Saves a bar chart of employee distribution as `employee_summary_chart.png`
Project Structure
```
Data_Cleaning_Reporting_Automation_Project/
├── automation_script.py    # Main pipeline script
└── raw_employee_data.csv   # Input data (Employee_ID, Department, Salary, Performance_Score)
```
Output Files (generated on run)
File	Description
`cleaned_employee_data.csv`	Deduplicated, imputed employee data
`department_report.xlsx`	Department-level summary statistics
`employee_summary_chart.png`	Bar chart of employee count by department
Setup & Run
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib openpyxl
python automation_script.py
```

4. Predictive Analytics Project
A time-series sales forecasting model using Linear Regression that predicts the next 12 months of sales from historical data.
Features
Parses and sorts historical monthly sales data
Trains a Linear Regression model on an 80/20 train-test split
Evaluates model using MAE, RMSE, and R² Score
Plots historical data vs. test predictions
Outputs a 12-month future sales forecast
Saves prediction chart as `prediction_plot.png`
Project Structure
```

├── predictive_model.py         # Model training, evaluation & forecasting
└── historical_sales_data.csv   # Input: Date, Sales (monthly)
```
Input Data Format
```
Date,Sales
2020-01-01,103.97
2020-02-01,111.71
...
```
Output
Console: MAE, RMSE, R² Score + 12-month forecast values
File: `prediction_plot.png` — historical vs predicted sales chart
Setup & Run
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
python predictive_model.py
```
